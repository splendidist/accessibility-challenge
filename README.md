Accessibility Challenge

Create a webpage that has at least a 95 Lighthouse score. Highest score wins.

The page must have:

- at least 3 images
- one h1, at least 2 h2s and as many h3s as is necessary
- at least 3 sections of content
- all real content, no filler text (consider borrowing the content from your favourite wikipedia article)
- at least 4 different "brand" colours, and the main background cannot be white
- some sort of JS interactivity when items are focussed (look at the demo code from today for help)
